        December 1, 2025

            With the Ghosts of K’aresh behind us, Azeroth stands on the precipice of a future overshadowed by Xal’atath and the relentless 
            advance of the Void. In "The Warning", the stage is set for what comes next before continuing the story in the Midnight 
            expansion. Players will also be welcomed home with the start of Housing Early Access!

            CONTINUING THE WAR WITHIN CAMPAIGN

                Though the Ghosts of K'aresh have been put to rest, a new danger looms. Vereesa Windrunner is stricken by visions of a new
                threat: a dire prophecy of Quel'Thalas' fall. You’ll continue The War Within campaign beginning with the Visions of a 
                Shadowed Sun quest found in your Adventure Guide (Shift-J) to learn more about what portents await.

            STAKE YOUR CLAIM WITH HOUSING EARLY ACCESS

                Players who have purchased any edition of the Midnight expansion can join a neighborhood, purchase a house, and start 
                customizing their new home with Housing Early Access! If you don’t have Midnight yet, don’t worry. You’ll still be able to 
                begin adding to your Housing collection through a variety of activities and achievements, or by purchasing them from vendors
                throughout Azeroth.

            NEW AND RETURNING PLAYER EXPERIENCES

                Whether you’re a new player or returning after a hiatus, we’ve got you covered. New players will discover a smoother 
                transition to get caught up with an updated New Player Experience. Players seeking to return to Azeroth will find a guided 
                Returning Player Experience to help you remember how to play the game and get you on the path to the next latest content in 
                World of Warcraft.

            NEW LOREWALKING: THE ELVES OF QUEL'THALAS

                retelling of the Scourge attack on Silvermoon City and the Lich King’s assault on the Sunwell. Later, you’ll find out more 
                about the tainting of the Sunwell by Alleria Windrunner, and the creation of the Void Elves.

            PANDAREN HERITAGE ARMOR

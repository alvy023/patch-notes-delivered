            Get ready for fast frenetic fun in Legion Remix as you meet up with the infinite dragonflight once more, level new characters, 
            and earn a variety of items to add to your collection. We’re also turning things up a notch during The War Within Season 3 with 
            increased rewards and improvements to help you gear up your Warband with Turbo-Boost and updates to the Cooldown Manager for 
            more customization.

            LEGION REMIX

                Legion Remix is a time-limited seasonal event where players can create a Timerunner as one of the original 12 Legion classes 
                and replay the entire Legion expansion at an accelerated pace from level 10-80 with some major gameplay twists. Players will 
                collect power, face epic challenges, and earn a mountain of collectables such as pets, mounts, and transmog gear.

                Legion Remix is accessible without purchasing a World of Warcraft expansion, but requires a Subscription or Game Time to 
                progress beyond level 20. Classic players can join by installing the modern World of Warcraft client, while Trial Accounts 
                can play up to level 20 for free before needing to subscribe. 

                To make your Timerunning journey even more rewarding, Bronze earnings have increased across key activities:
                    • Bronze from Bronze Caches substantially increased.
                    • All Infinite Research quests now have a bonus of 1000 Bronze.
                    • Emissary quests now reward 4000 Bronze.

                    • World Quests now reward 200 Bronze.
                
            TURBO-BOOST RETURNS

                We’re turning things up a notch during The War Within Season 3 with increased rewards and improvements to help you gear up 
                your Warband with Turbo-Boost.

                With the initial 11.2.5 release:
                    Hero and Myth upgrade tracks will extend 2 upgrades (from 6 to 8) and crafted items will be recraftable with an 
                    Augmentation Matrix for additional power. 

                Soon after the 11.2.5 release:
                    As of the week of October 21, the cap for Crests is lifted, and Valorstones become Warbound for the remainder of the 
                    season. Mythic+ drop rates for Warband until Equipped gear are also being doubled. Ethereal Voidsplinters may be earned 
                    in Mythic+ dungeons, Manaforge Omega, Delves, and rated PvP to fuel the Catalyst.

                    Two new quests become available that require players to defeat 4 raid bosses from the raid on Normal difficulty or 
                    higher, or to complete 4 Mythic+ dungeons. Completing the one time only quest Turbo Boost: Trade Must Flow will reward 
                    players with 3 Puzzling Cartel Chips and the weekly quest Turbo Boost: Infinite Growth will reward 1 Puzzling Cartel 
                    Chip. Players will be able to earn a maximum of 9 Puzzling Cartel Chips per character.

                    Fixer So’kir and Fixer So’tho will visit Dornogal to offer powerful weapons, trinkets, and cantrip items from Season 3 
                    dungeons and Manaforge Omega in exchange for Puzzling Cartel Chips after adventurers have proved themselves worthy.

                    Additionally, delves will be charged with boosts:
                        • Increased Delver's Journey progress and Crests earned after delve completion.
                        • Increased weekly Valorstones and Crests earned from the Delver's Bounty.
                        • Additional weekly source of companion experience from Delver's Bounty.
                        • Tiers 9 and above can drop Champion 1/8 Warbound equipment.
                        • Untainted Mana-Crystals can be obtained from opening Bountiful Coffers with Restored Coffer Keys inside of 
                          bountiful delves at Tier 9 or above after reaching rank 3 of the Delver's Journey. These mana-crystals can be 
                          traded with Zah'ran for Hero track trinkets.

            ITEMS

                      Default. Spells can be dragged to reorder them in the Cooldown Manager, and they can be dragged between categories. 
                      To disable a spell, drag it to the Hidden by Default category. Spells you have not learned can still be configured,

                        > Groups that are reported will no longer appear in the list after subsequent searches.
                    • The Move Pad, accessible via Settings > General, now supports Press and Hold functionality. This option can be found

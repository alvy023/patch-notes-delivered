            Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on August 5. Explore a new zone, 
            break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on 
            August 12 with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season.

        CONTINUE THE WAR WITHIN CAMPAIGN

            - In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this 
              content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the 
              Worldsoul Saga—Midnight.
            - There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are 
              determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will 
              also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord.

        EXPLORE THE SHATTERED WORLD OF K'ARESH

            - Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for 
              players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, 
              including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives.
            - With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid 
              to put a stop to him and his followers.

        RETURN TO TAZAVESH, THE VEILED MARKET

            - Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands 
              to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos 
              beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them.
            - Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active 
              Bountiful Delves.
            - A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-
              Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what 
              remains of K'aresh.

        RESHII WRAPS UPGRADEABLE ARTIFACT

            - Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to 
              transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to 
              take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more!
            - Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content.

        WRAP UP AND GO PHASE DIVING

            - Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, 
              objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world.
            - You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will 
              also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious 
              monsters for fun… and profit.

        NEW SYSTEM: ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION

            - Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the 
              ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting 
              to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new 
              future.

        MANAFORGE OMEGA RAID (TWW Season 3)
            
            - Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, 
              Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth 
              must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself.
            - Raid Bosses:
                • Plexus Sentinel
                • Loom'ithar
                • Soulbinder Naazindhri
                • Forgeweaver Araz
                • The Soul Hunters

                • Nexus-King Salhadaar
                • Dimensius, the All-Devouring
            - Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and 
              for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits.
            - Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, 
              filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid.

        ECO-DOME AL'DANI DUNGEON (TWW Season 3)
            
            - The storyline of Al'dani takes place following the events of the Manaforge Omega raid. The eco-domes represent the best hope 
              for restoring life to K'aresh, and Eco-Dome Al'dani was built on the site of one of the most sacred locations on K'aresh. A 
              Wastelander invasion has ripped open the dome, exposing it to destruction. Ve'nari has called for help to keep K'aresh's great 
              hope from being destroyed. Join the ethereals' efforts to regain control by clearing the new three-boss dungeon, earning 
              rewards, and exploring the latest content.
            - Dungeon Bosses:
                • Azhiccar
                • Taah'bat and A'wazj

            - The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and 
              two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer.

        NEW DUNGEON POOL (TWW Season 3)
    
            - Dungeons:
                • Ara-Kara, City of Echoes (Azj-Kahet)
                • The Dawnbreaker (Hallowfall)
                • Eco-Dome Al'dani (K’aresh)

                • Priory of the Sacred Flame (Hallowfall)

              once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, 
              and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the 
              dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the 
              mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to 
              defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying.
            - Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear 
              on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well.

        NEW DELVE: THE ARCHIVAL ASSAULT (TWW Season 3)
    
            - Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are 
              plundering the Delve. Upgrading and using the Reshii Wraps unlocks unique challenge gateways to powerful bosses and reveals 
              hidden secrets when you revisit your favorite delves across Khaz Algar. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the 
              Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died.
            - There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season's Nemesis.
            - Along the Delver's Journey progression, unlock customizations for your Delver's Mana Skimmer–the newest Delve mount attainable 
              during Season 3–and two new toys, the Delver's Mana-Bound Ethergate–opens a portal to return to the Explorers' League home 
              base in Dornogal, and Etheric Brannmorpher–summons an Ethereal Transmorpher that can change your appearance.

        NEW WORLD BOSS: RESHANOR, THE UNTETHERED (TWW Season 3)
    
            - The ethereals of K'aresh first witnessed this destructive maw of the void after Dimensius's attack. They believe Reshanor has 
              manifested as their eternal punishment - for it comes back around to keep eating them and their planet as he grows infinitely 
              bigger over the years.

        SEASON 3 CLASS SETS
    
            - With a new season, also comes a new set of class gear. These new sets will feature set bonuses that will align with your 
              chosen Hero Talents instead of your class or specialization.

        SEASON 3 PVP
    
            - The new season also brings a new PvP Ladder, increased item level gear, and new rewards: Arena title: "Astral Gladiator", 
              Rated Solo Shuffle title: "Astral Legend", Rated Battleground Blitz title: "Astral Marshal" (Alliance) or "Astral Warlord" 
              (Horde), a new weapon illusion: Arcane, tabard, cloak, pennants, weapon appearances, Astral Gladiator's Fel Bat, and new 
              Vicious mounts–Alliance and Horde-themed Void Creepers.
            - Several PvP talents will be updated with the content update; players will also be able to undertake a new World Quest to 
              vanquish their foes on Vanquisher’s Wake island. This new point of interest is a perfect spot to hang out for those seeking to
              go toe-to-toe in some outdoor PvP battles. No quest required for entry. Simply turn on War Mode and enter with caution.

        CLASSES (TWW Season 3)

            - Developers' notes: We’re making an adjustment to healing cooldowns to increase their strength in smaller group play without 
              affecting their performance at 20 targets. This is intended to be an overall large buff in 5 player content, a medium to small 
              buff between 6-19 players, no change at 20 players, and a nerf beyond 20 players.
            - We also adjusted some of the outlier Liberation of Undermine tier bonuses and providing some compensation where relevant to 
              ensure a smooth transition into the Manaforge Omega tier bonuses. We’ll continue to monitor the impact of these changes and 
              adjust accordingly.

        DEATH KNIGHT
    
            - Developer’s notes: In Ghosts of K'aresh we are looking at Death Knight's raid utility to help give them a better identity that
              isn't completely reliant on tuning to make an impact. One immediate change you may notice is that Abomination Limb has been 
              removed, its existence made it incredibly hard for grip to matter in any real capacity because of how potent and easily 
              accessible it became. This led to many raid mobs being immune to grip as way to counter what should normally be one of Death 
              Knight's most powerful tools. This change limits the number of Death Grips available to a raid at any moment and allows us to 
              design more moments for Death Grip to be tactical and powerful when Death Knights choose to use it.
            - This change should be immediately apparent in the new raid Manaforge Omega.
            - Secondly, plenty of time has passed since Castle Nathria and it's given us some time to reflect on our change to capping 
              Anti-Magic Zone. In Ghosts of K'aresh, we are returning AMZ to a % magic damage reduction effect with no cap. We have 
              increased the cooldown and reduced the duration and effectiveness downward from what it was prior to the Castle Nathria nerf 
              which should better align with our expected output for a DPS/Tank Damage Reduction cooldown. We hope that by adding this back 
              as a meaningful cooldown alongside their grips that Death Knight's will be able to carve out a spot for themselves in raid 
              compositions.
            - New Talent: Unholy Momentum – Increases the Death Knight's Haste by 2%.
            - Anti-Magic Zone has been updated – Places an Anti-Magic Zone for 6 seconds, reducing the magic damage taken by party or raid 
              members by 15%. 4 minute cooldown.
            - Assimilation has been updated – The cooldown of Anti-Magic Zone is reduced by 60 seconds and its duration is increased by 2 
              seconds.
            - The following talents have been removed:
                • Abomination Limb
                • Unholy Ground
            - Hero Talents
                • Deathbringer
                    > Exterminate has been updated:
                        + First scythe of Exterminate no longer has a chance to apply Reaper's Mark.
                        + Frost – First scythe of Exterminate has a 100% chance to grant Killing Machine.
                        + Blood – The first scythe now has a 100% chance to reap a Bonestorm for 2 seconds.
                    > Developer’s notes: We found that relying on chance for Reaper’s Mark created too much variance in damage output, 
                      which made it feel inconsistent and unreliable.
                    > Reaper's Mark damage increased by 30%.
                    > Frost
                        + Exterminate first scythe damage reduced by 15%.
                        + Exterminate second scythe damage has been increased by 20%.
                        + Bind in Darkness now increases Howling Blast damage on main target when consuming Rime by 60% (was 30%).
                        + Wave of Souls critical strikes now increase the Shadowfrost damage the target takes by 3% per stack (was 5%).
                        + Swift and Painful now increases Strength by 5% for 8 seconds when no enemies are struck by Soul Rupture (was 10%).
                        + Swift and Painful now causes Wave of Souls to be 50% more effective on its main target (was 100%).
                • Rider of the Apocalypse
                    > Undeath damage reduced by 20%.
                    > Reaper's Mark will no longer automatically explode below 5% health.
                    > Reaper's Mark will now instead travel to the nearest enemy when the affected target dies.
                    > Mawsworn Menace now reduces the cooldown of Death and Decay by 5 seconds (was 10 seconds).
                    > Mograine's Death and Decay damage increased by 50%.
                    > Fixed an issue causing Undeath to benefit only one Death Knight in a group with multiple Death Knights.
                    > Frost
                        + Mawsworn Menace has been updated – Increases the damage of Obliterate by 10% and Remorseless Winter lasts 2 
                          seconds longer.
                        + Mograine's Might has been updated – Your damage is increased by 5% and you gain 5% Critical Strike chance while 
                          inside Mograine's Death and Decay.
                        + Trollbane's Icy Fury damage reduced by 30%.
                        + Frostscythe now shatters Trollbane's Chains of Ice.
                        + Whitemane's Famine now causes Frostscythe to add a stack to Undeath and spreads it to a nearby enemy.
                    > Unholy
                        + Whitemane's Death Coil damage increased by 100%.
                        + Brittle and Unholy Assault now affects Undeath damage.
                        + The War effect of Rune of the Apocalypse now affects Undeath damage.
                        + Unholy Aura now increases the damage of Whitemane's Undeath.
                        + Fixed an issue causing Whitemane's Epidemic to benefit from Mastery twice.
                        + Fixed an issue causing Mograine's Death and Decay to benefit twice from Unholy Death Knight Mastery.
                • San’layn
                    > The Blood is Life has been updated:
                        + Dark Transformation/Dancing Rune Weapon summons a Blood Beast to attack your enemy for 10 seconds.
                    > Developer’s notes: Similar to Exterminate updates, we found that the chance based spawning of Blood Beast created too 
                      much variance in damage output and reduced player agency.
                    > Blood Beast now deals 15% of the damage accumulated for Unholy and 25% of the damage accumulated for Blood 
                      specialization (was 25%/50%).
                    > Blood Beast's Corrupted Blood damage increased by 25%.
                    > Pact of the San'layn now stores 15% of the Shadow damage done into Blood Beast (was 10%).
                    > Infliction of Sorrow now has an additional effect – After Gift of the San'layn ends, you gain a charge of Death and 
                      Decay.
                    > Infliction of Sorrow buff that makes Scourge Strike/Heart Strike to consume Virulent Plague/Blood Plague now lasts for

                    > Frenzied Bloodthirst now increases the damage of Death Coil by 4% per stack of Essence of the Blood Queen (was 5%).
                    > Blood
                        + Visceral Strength now has an additional effect – When Blood Boil hits 2 or more targets, it generates 1 charge of 
                          Bone Shield.
                    > Unholy
                        + Visceral Strength now has an additional effect – When Scourge Strike consumes Virulent Plague, your next Outbreak 
                          costs no Runes and casts a Death Coil or an Epidemic at 100% effectiveness, whichever you most recently cast.
            - Blood
                • All ability damage increased by 8%.
                • Bone Shield increases Armor by 115% of Strength (was 100%).
            - Frost
                • Developer’s notes: In Ghosts of K'aresh, we're revisiting the core building blocks of Frost Death Knight. We're making 
                  adjustments to reduce friction between how the spec uses its resources and to focus its power into more iconic abilities, 
                  alongside some new ones we hope you’ll enjoy.
                • Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.

                • New Talent: Icy Onslaught – Frost Strike and Glacial Advance now cause your next Frost Strike and Glacial Advance to deal 
                  15% increased damage and cost 5 more Runic Power. This effect stacks until the next Runic Empowerment.
                • New Talent: Frostbane - When you cast Arctic Assault, each foe struck has a chance to transform your next Frost Strike 
                  into Frostbane. The chance increases with the number of Razorice stacks on the target.
                    > Frostbane - Start a frozen onslaught that strikes twice, unleashing the chilling essence of winter, dealing Frost 
                      damage to all enemies caught in its wake with each strike. Each enemy struck reduces the damage dealt to the next foe 
                      by 5%, down to 40%.
                • Developer’s notes: We wanted to move away from tab-targeting Frost Strike gameplay as it is difficult to execute and track, 
                  and used this opportunity to design a new capstone talent.
                • New Talent: Killing Streak – Obliterate and Frostscythe consume all Killing Machines to deal 25% increased critical strike 
                  damage and grants 1.5% Haste for 6 seconds or each stack consumed. Multiple applications may overlap.
                • New Talent: Northwinds – Howling Blast now hits an additional target with maximum effectiveness. Rime increases Howling 
                  Blast damage done by an additional 75%.
                • New Talent: Frostreaper – Obliterate deals 10% increased damage and has a chance to tether the souls of its target and a 
                  nearby enemy to yours. Frost Strike severs the tethers, dealing Shadowfrost damage to both foes.
                • New Talent: Howling Blades – Rime empowered Howling Blast unleashes 2 icy blades at its target that deal Frost damage and 
                  have a 15% chance to grant Killing Machine.
                • New Talent: Frozen Dominion – Pillar of Frost casts a Remorseless Winter that lasts 4 seconds longer. Each enemy 
                  Remorseless Winter damages grants you 8% Mastery, up to 40% for 15 seconds. Replaces Remorseless Winter.
                • Empower Rune Weapon has been redesigned – Drain the will of your enemy to empower your rune weapon, dealing Shadowfrost 
                  damage and reduced damage to enemies nearby, gaining 40 Runic Power and grants you Killing Machine. Has 2 charges with a 
                  30 second recharge. No longer incurs the global cooldown, but has its own 0.75 second cooldown on cast. Visual effects 
                  have been updated.
                • Developer’s notes: We've found that there were too many passive effects that granted Rune or Runic Power in Frost Death 
                  Knight's resource economy. While moving away from some of these passive effects, we want to give you the tools to use your 
                  resources more methodically.
                • Breath of Sindragosa has been redesigned – Call upon Sindragosa's aid in battle for 8 seconds, continuously dealing Frost 
                  damage every 1 second to enemies in a cone in front of you. Consuming Killing Machine or Rime increases the duration by 
                  0.8 seconds. Deals reduced damage to secondary targets. Grants a charge of Empower Rune Weapon at the start and 2 Runes at 
                  the end. 1.5 minute cooldown, costs 60 Runic Power.
                • Rime has been updated – Frost Strike and Glacial Advance have a 45% chance and Breath of Sindragosa has a 30% chance to 
                  cause your next Howling Blast to consume no Runes and deal additional damage (was Obliterate 45% and Frostscythe 22.5%).
                • Developer’s notes: One of our main goals with this update is to make Runic Power spenders feel better to use. The 
                  interaction between Obliterate and Howling Blast was making it difficult to use Runic Power spenders without over capping 
                  on Rime, Killing Machine and Runic Power.
                • Might of the Frozen Wastes has been updated – Wielding a two-handed weapon now increases Obliterate damage by 30% and 
                  Frostscythe damage by 30%. The rest of the effect stays the same.
                • Frostscythe has been updated – A sweeping attack that strikes all enemies in front of you for Frost damage. Deals reduced 
                  damage beyond 5 targets. Consumes Killing Machine to have its critical strikes deal 4 times the normal damage. Costs 2 
                  Runes and has no cooldown. Visual effects and animations have been updated.
                • Cleaving Strikes has been updated – Frostscythe deals 20% increased damage during Remorseless Winter.
                • Developer’s notes: We're moving away Obliterate cleave and aiming for a new vision for how Frost Death Knight deals damage 
                  in AoE with Frostscythe. This will also help us in adjusting the power of abilities more effectively.
                • Everfrost has been updated – Rime empowered Howling Blast deals 50% increased damage to secondary targets. Remorseless 
                  Winter deals 6% increased damage to enemies it hits, stacking up to 10 times.
                • Rage of the Frozen Champion has been updated – Frost Strike and Glacial Advance have a 15% increased chance to trigger 
                  Rime and Howling Blast generates 8 Runic Power while Rime is active.
                • Frigid Executioner has been updated – Runic Empowerment has a 25% chance to refund 1 additional Rune.
                • Cryogenic Chamber has been updated – When Howling Blast consumes Rime, 15% of the damage it deals is stored in the next 
                  cast of Remorseless Winter.
                • Obliteration has been updated – During Pillar of Frost, Frost Strike, Glacial Advance, and Howling Blast always grant 
                  Killing Machine and have a 20% chance to generate a Rune. Additionally during Pillar of Frost, Empower Rune Weapon causes 
                  your next Obliterate or Frostscythe to cost no Runes.
                • All ability damage reduced by 8%.
                • Glacial Advance is now learned at level 10 (was a talent).
                • Developer’s notes: We're making Glacial Advance baseline to allow Frost Death Knight to use Runic Power in AoE without 
                  having to spend a talent point, especially for early leveling experience.
                • Glacial Advance damage increased by 25%.
                • Obliterate damage increased by 24%.
                • Arctic Assault now triggers a Glacial Advance at 60% effectiveness.
                • All Runic Power spenders now cost 35 Runic Power.

                • Artic Assault now causes consuming Killing Machine to fire a Glacial Advance through your target at 45% effectiveness 
                  (was 80%).
                • Inexorable Assault now causes Obliterate and Frostscythe to consume up to 3 stacks of Inexorable Assault (was 1) and 
                  grants a stack every 4 seconds (was 8 seconds).
                • Shattering Blade now makes Glacial Advance apply Razorice on top of its original effect.
                • Frostwyrm's Fury is now a 90 second cooldown (was 3 minutes) and stuns targets for 3 seconds baseline. Visual effect and 
                  animation has been updated.
                • Frost Strike visual effects updated.
                • The following talents have been removed:
                    > Absolute Zero
                    > Chill Streak

                    > Piercing Chill
                    > Shattered Frost
            - Unholy
                • Developer’s notes: With Ghosts of K'aresh we're looking into reducing the number of cooldowns Unholy Death Knight has and 
                  provide some new tools to both apply and remove Festering Wounds in AoE more efficiently, specifically to help with ramp 
                  up speed at the beginning of M+ dungeons.
                • Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
                • New Talent: Plague Mastery – Critical strike damage of your diseases is increased by 25%.

                  Desecrate after it is cast.

                      Applies or bursts 1-2 Festering Wounds, depending on whether the target is already affected by Festering Wounds.

                • All Will Serve has been redesigned – Raise Dead summons an additional skeletal archer at your command that shoots 
                  Blighted Arrows.
                    > Blighted Arrow – An unholy arrow that deals Shadow damage. When consuming Sudden Doom, your Death Coil commands your 
                      archer to fire an additional Blighted Arrow at 80% effectiveness. Epidemic will instead cause Blighted Arrow to 
                      ricochet and hit up to 2 additional targets.
                • Reaping now has an additional effect – Soul Reaper's execute effect increases the damage of your minions by 10% for 8 
                  seconds.
                • Mastery: Dreadblade now has an additional effect – Increases the critical strike damage of your minions and diseases 20%. 
                  Scaling at a reduced amount.

                • Festering Wound burst damage increased by 25%.
                • Apocalypse now replaces Dark Transformation if it is known and also summons your pet ghoul on cast.
                • Decomposition now causes Virulent Plague to have a chance to deal 100%/200% of the damage it dealt in the last 4 seconds 
                  (was 50%/100%).
                • Death and Decay damage has been increased by 100%. Does not affect Defile.

                • Sudden Doom no longer reduces the Runic Power cost of Epidemic (was reducing by 10).
                • Developers' notes: We've noticed that lowering the cost of Epidemic led Unholy Death Knight to keep over capping Runic 
                  Power due to rotational priorities around bursting Festering Wounds, and how much Runic Power bursting Festering Wounds 
                  grants in AoE situations.

                • Developers' notes: Preservation doesn't have access to a damage reduction external ability outside of Renewing Blaze as 
                  Flameshaper, which hurts their potential in content like Mythic+. This opens up the possibility for them to save their 
                  tank from massive damage.
                • All healing reduced by 4%.
                • Emerald Blossom healing increased by 25%.
                • Dream Breath healing reduced by 20%.
                • Dream Flight healing increased by 150%. Healing no longer increased by 100% outside of raid and the healing amount now 
                  diminishes beyond 5 targets.
                • Reversion now has 2 charges.
                • Temporal Artificer reduces Rewind cooldown by 120 seconds (was 60 seconds).
                • Developers' notes: Stasis' power has made it feel required to take, which forces players into the bottom right capstone 
                  branch. By moving it further up in the tree, we reduce the opportunity cost of picking Stasis. At the same time, we're 
                  offering an easy-to-play talent that competes with Stasis so you don't feel required to use Stasis if you don't want to.
                • Temporal Anomaly absorption increased by 330%. Absorption beyond 5 targets now diminishes more sharply.
                • Developers' notes: We would like Temporal Anomaly to be a more effective tool for Preservation Evokers in dungeons to 
                  prevent damage on the group. To prevent it from scaling too well in raid, the absorption will now very quickly diminish 
                  when reaching additional targets beyond 5.
                • Fixed an issue that prevented Lifebind from transferring Emerald Communion healing when the Evoker has a healing absorb.
                • Stasis is now a choice talent with Temporal Artificer.
                • The following talents have been removed:
                    > Erasure
                    > Punctuality

        HUNTER

            - New Talent: Harmonize – Pet damage increased by 4%.
            - Developers' notes: Explosive Shot hasn’t found a great home in Beast Mastery’s kit, so we’re offering an opportunity to trade 
              it for some pet damage.
            - Blackrock Munitions now also increases the pet damage bonus of Harmonize by 2%.
            - Moment of Opportunity no longer has an internal cooldown.
            - Hero Talents
                • Dark Ranger
                    > Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
                    > New Talent: Umbral Reach – Black Arrow periodic damage increased by 100% and Bleak Powder now applies Black Arrow's 
                      periodic effect to all enemies it damages. If Bleak Powder damages 2 or more enemies, gain Beast Cleave/Trick Shots if 
                      talented.
                    > Developers' notes: Black Arrow can have a confusing priority in AOE scenarios for both Marksmanship and Beast Mastery. 
                      Umbral Reach should give Black Arrow a clearer place in your AOE rotation without completely circumventing the need to 
                      use Multi-Shot.
                    > Soul Drinker has been updated – Now increases Black Arrow’s damage by 8% and Bleak Powder’s damage by 10%.
                    > Withering Fire has been updated – Now prioritizes units without Black Arrow’s periodic effect.
                    > Black Arrow’s periodic damage is now a rolling periodic.
                    > Bleak Powder damage reduced by 25%.
                    > Bleak Powder now deals reduced damage beyond 8 targets.
                    > Bleak Powder now correctly scales with Mastery: Sniper Training and Mastery: Master of Beasts.
                    > Phantom Pain damage share now affects up to 8 targets.
                    > The following talents have been removed:
                        + Embrace the Shadows
                        + Shadow Surge
                    > Beast Mastery
                        + The Bell Tolls’ previous effect is now baseline to Black Arrow and has been updated – Firing a Black Arrow 
                          increases all damage dealt by you and your pets by 6% for 12 seconds. Multiple instances of this effect may 
                          overlap.
                        + Black Arrow damage increased by 44%.
                        + Phantom Pain damage replication is now 30% (was 8%).
                        + Dark Hounds no longer have a chance to summon alongside Dire Beasts.
                    > Marksmanship
                        + The Bell Tolls’ previous effect is now baseline to Black Arrow and has been updated – Firing a Black Arrow 
                          increases all damage dealt by 3% for 12 seconds. Multiple instances of this effect may overlap.
                        + Black Arrow damage reduced by 23%.
                        + Phantom Pain damage replication is now 15% (was 24%). Damage is now replicated to up to 8 targets.
                • Pack Leader
                    > Shell Cover has been updated – When dropping below 60% health, summon the aid of a Turtle, reducing the damage you 
                      take by 15%. Damage reduction increased as health is reduced, up to 35% damage reduction at 10% health. Can only occur 
                      once every 90 seconds.
                    > Better Together has been updated – Damage dealt by your pets is increased by 3/15%. Frenzy’s attack speed bonus is 
                      increased by 3%/Tip of the Spear’s damage bonus increased by 15%.
                    > Dire Summons has been updated – Raptor Strike/Mongoose Bite reduction increased to 1.5 seconds (was 1 second).
                    > Rend Flesh’s damage reduced by 30%.
                    > Developers' notes: Bleeds ignore armor, which Rend Flesh was not doing before, so this reduction is intended to keep 
                      its damage roughly neutral in power.
                    > Howl of the Pack Leader now displays an activation overlay when a Beast summon is ready.
                    > The Pack Leader Bear now properly benefits from pet avoidance.
                    > Fixed an issue causing Rend Flesh to not be treated as Bleed.
                    > Survival
                        + Dire Summons' Kill Command reduction increased to 2.5 seconds (was 2 seconds).
                • Sentinel
                    > Lunar Storm now resets the cooldown of Rapid Fire and Wildfire Bomb when it becomes available.
                    > Developers' notes: This should help to reduce the cognitive load around tracking Lunar Storm while providing some more 
                      excitement.
            - Beast Mastery
                • Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
                • New Talent: Wildspeaker – Dire Beasts will now obey your Kill Command, dealing damage at 30% effectiveness. Bestial Wrath 
                  now sends your Dire Beasts into a rage, increasing their damage dealt by 15% for 15 seconds. Dire Beasts summoned during a 
                  Bestial Wrath will benefit at a reduced duration.
                • Mastery: Master of Beasts has been updated – Now also increase the damage of your shots and traps at 50% value.
                • Dire Beast has been updated – Now a passive ability. Damage from your bleed effects has a 4% chance of attracting a 
                  powerful wild beast that attacks your target for 8 seconds.
                • Bloodshed has been redesigned – Duration reduced to 12 seconds (was 18 seconds). Damage over time increased to every 1 
                  second (was 3 seconds). Bleed damage increased substantially. Bleed damage from Bloodshed now has a higher chance to 
                  attract a Dire Beast.
                • Killer Instinct has been updated – Kill Command’s damage is increased by 8/16%.
                • Developers' notes: Beast Mastery was bringing more execute damage than we’d like. We’d prefer Marksmanship to be the 
                  Hunter class’s premier execute damage contributor.
                • Huntmaster’s Call has been updated:
                    > Now requires 6 Dire Beast summons to trigger.
                    > Hati and Fenryr base damage increased to about double of a normal Dire Beast’s damage.
                    > Hati and Fenryr duration reduced to 10 seconds (was 15 seconds).
                    > Fenryr’s Ravenous Leap damage increased by 500%.
                    > Fenryr Haste buff reduced to 4% (was 8%).
                    > Hati pet damage buff reduced to 4% (was 8%).
                • All damage dealt reduced by 10%.
                • Barbed Shot now replaces Steady Shot.
                • Hunter’s Prey no longer causes Kill Shot to strike additional targets.
                • Developers' notes: By removing the additional targets, we can more reliably increase Black Arrow’s power without creeping 
                  Beast Mastery Dark Ranger’s AoE.
                • Liberation of Undermine 2-set updated – Chance to trigger the bonus reduced and no longer scales with Haste.
                • Liberation of Undermine 4-set updated – Bestial Wrath cooldown reduction reduced to 0.1 second (was 0.25 seconds). 
                  Mutagenic attack damage reduced by 33%.
                • Fixed an issue with Huntmaster’s Call that was causing Hati and Frenyr’s attacks to have higher than usual variance.
                • Master Handler has had its icon updated.
                • Dire Beast is no longer tracked on the Cooldown Manger.
                • The following talents have been removed:
                    > Barrage
                    > Shower of Blood
                    > Venomous Bite
            - Marksmanship
                • Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
                • New Talent: Unmatched Precision – The damage bonus of Precise Shots is increased by 20/40%.
                • New Talent: Light Ammo – Trick Shots now causes Aimed Shot and Rapid Fire to ricochet to 2 additional targets. Aspect of 
                  the Hydra's damage bonus is increased by 15%.
                • Shrapnel Shot has been redesigned – Explosive Shot has a 100% chance to grant Lock and Load.
                • Developers' notes: We’ve heard feedback that players have really enjoyed the gameplay of the Liberation of Undermine set 
                  bonus. We’re hoping Precision Detonation and the new Shrapnel Shot will strike a similar chord.
                • Improved Spotter’s Mark renamed to Avian Specialization and has been updated – Now also teaches your Eagle to Fetch loot 
                  from nearby corpses.
                • Ohn’ahran Winds has been updated – When your Eagle applies Spotter’s Mark, it has a 100% chance to apply a Spotter’s Mark 
                  to up to 1 additional nearby enemy at 100% effectiveness.
                • Developers' notes: Our goal with this change is to increase the talent's consistency and give it a clearer niche.
                • Precise Shots has been updated – Now also reduces the global cooldown of affected spells by 50%.
                • Developers' notes - Our goal with this change is to help make Precise Shots spending feel more snappy, responsive, and 
                  exciting in all situations.
                • Kill Zone has been updated – Line of sight ignoring effect now lingers for 3 seconds upon removal.
                • Calling the Shots has been updated – Now reduces the cooldown of Trueshot by 30 seconds.
                • Developers' notes: Calling the Shots has been historically inconsistent, so we're simplifying it to increase its 
                  reliability.
                • Moving Target has been updated – Aimed Shot damage bonus reduced to 8%.
                • Developers' notes: We’re moving some of Moving Target’s Aimed Shot damage into Aimed Shot’s baseline power.
                • All damage dealt reduced by 10%.
                • Aimed Shot damage increased by 10%.
                • Lock and Load chance to trigger increased to 10% (was 8%) and it now benefits from bad luck protection.
                • Precision Detonation damage bonus increased to 40% (was 25%).
                • Trick Shots effectiveness reduced to 60% (was 75%).
                • Aspect of the Hydra and Ohn’ahran Winds additional target seek range increased to 12 yards (was 8 yards).
                • Unerring Vision no longer affects Calling the Shots.
                • Liberation of Undermine 4 set has been updated – Explosive Shot effectiveness reduced to 125% (was 300%) and no longer 
                  triggers Shrapnel Shot.
                • Bullseye is no longer a 2-point node.
                • Fixed several targeting issues with Ohn’ahran Winds.
                • The following talents have been removed:
                    > Killer Mark
                    > Quickdraw
            - Survival
                • Improved Wildfire Bomb has returned – Wildfire Bomb damage increased by 8%.
                • Developers' notes: Wildfire Arsenal’s was adding a lot of auras and overhead for what amounted to a lower damage 
                  contribution than Improved Wildfire Bomb, so we’re bringing back the simpler and more potent Improved Wildfire Bomb node.
                • Cull the Herd has been redesigned – Kill Shot deals an additional 30% damage over 6 seconds.
                • Developers' notes: We’ve heard feedback that Cull the Herd’s initial implementation felt like a miss, so we’re simplifying 
                  it and increasing its power.
                • Born to Kill has been redesigned – Your chance to gain Deathblow is increased by 5% and Kill Shot’s damage is increased 
                  by 25%.
                • Wildfire Bomb initial damage increased by 50%.
                • Ruthless Marauder Tip of the Spear chance to trigger increased to 100% (was 20%).
                • Explosives Expert now increases Wildfire Bomb and Explosive Shot damage by 5/10% (was 2.5/5%).
                • Bloodseeker no longer causes Kill Command to Bleed.
                • Kill Command cooldown resets will no longer display an activation overlay.
                • Fixed an issue where the old version of Wildfire Arsenal could still trigger from Quick Shots.
                • Wildfire Arsenal has been removed.

        MAGE

            - Inspired Intellect now grants 6% increased Intellect (was 3%).
            - Time Anomaly has been removed.
            - Hero Talents
                • Frostfire
                    > Fire
                        + Frostfire Burst damage increased by 50%.
                        + Excess Frost now casts Ice Nova at 200% effectiveness (was 150%).
                    > Frost
                        + Excess Fire has been updated – Now has a 50% chance to grant Brain Freeze (was 100%).
                • Spellslinger
                    > Spellfrost Teachings has been redesigned – Splinters direct damage reduces the cooldown of Arcane Orb by 0.5 seconds 
                      and Frozen Orb by 0.5 seconds.
                    > Developers' notes: Spellfrost Teachings was a huge source of variance for both Arcane and Frost Spellslingers. Our 
                      goal with this change is to smooth out the rate at which Spellslingers fire Orbs without significantly impacting total 
                      number of Orbs casted over the course of an encounter. We’re also moving some of Spellfrost Teaching’s power into the 
                      Splintering Orb damage bonus as compensation.
                    > Splintering Orbs damage bonus increased to 25% (was 10%).
                    > Splinterstorms now have a 10% chance to grant Brain Freeze (was 5%).
                    > Splinterstorms now have an 8% chance to grant Clearcasting (was 5%).
                    > Arcane
                        + All Splinter damage increased by 40%.
                • Sunfury
                    > Arcane
                        + Meteorite damage increased by 2%.
                        + Arcane Phoenix area-of-effect spell damage increased by 17%.
                    > Fire
                        + Meteorite damage reduced by 15%.
                        + Arcane Phoenix area-of-effect spell damage reduced by 10%.
            - Arcane
                • Mastery: Savant has been updated:
                    > Mana bonuses increased by 10%.
                    > Arcane Blast damage bonus increased by 30%.
                    > Arcane Barrage damage bonus increased by 40%.
                    > Arcane damage bonus increased by 10%.
                • Prodigious Savant has been updated – Arcane Charges now increase the damage of Arcane Blast and Arcane Barrage by an 
                  additional 15/30%.
                • Developers' notes: We’re simplifying Prodigious Savant and buffing Mastery: Savant to make Mastery a more appealing stat 
                  for Arcane.
                • All damage dealt increased by 3%.
                • Resonance damage bonus reduced to 12% (was 15%).
                • Arcane Orb travel speed increased to 30 yards/second.
                • Developers' notes: We're increasing Arcane Orb's travel speed to help make its charge generation more snappy.
                • Intuition duration increased to 5 seconds (was 3 seconds).
                • Developers' notes: We're generally pleased with how Intuition has landed in Arcane Mage's Barrage priority and are 
                  comfortable increasing its duration.
                • Liberation of Undermine 2-set bonus has been updated – Chance to trigger reduced.
                • Arcane Rebound and Static Cloud have swapped locations in the talent tree.
                • Arcane Rebound’s icon has been updated.
                • Arcane Harmony is now tracked on the Personal Resource Display.
                • Aether Attunement is now tracked on the cooldown manager.
                • Fixed an issue where consuming Intuition as soon as it triggers would not increase Arcane Barrage’s damage correctly.
            - Fire
                • Meteor has been updated – The enemy closest to the center of Meteor’s impact now takes 40% increased damage.
                • Developers' notes: Meteor has been lacking some punch, particularly in single target, so we're taking a swing at making it 
                  a more generally attractive option.
                • Hyperthermia has been updated – Casting Pyroblast or Flamestrike during Hyperthermia increases the damage of Pyroblast and 
                  Flamestrike by 15%, up to 150%.
                • Controlled Destruction has been updated – Ignite damage bonus reduced to 0.3% per stack (was 0.5% per stack).
                • Mastery: Ignite damage reduced by 10%.
                • Meteor damage increased by 20%.
                • Pyroblast damage increased by 30%.
                • Flamestrike damage increased by 10%.
                • Liberation of Undermine 2-set bonus has been updated – Chance to trigger reduced. Combustion effectiveness reduced to 
                  100% (was 200%).
                • Liberation of Undermine 4-set bonus has been updated – Rollin’ Hot damage bonus reduced to 8% (was 15%).
            - Frost
                • Mastery: Icicles has been updated – All damage bonuses increased by 40%.
                • Developers' notes: Frost's Mastery has been significantly behind other stats, so we're taking a big swing at improving it. 
                  We will continue to monitor these changes and update Mastery: Icicles as necessary.
                • All damage dealt increased by 10%.
                • Blizzard cooldown and duration increased to 15 seconds.
                • Developers' notes: We've received feedback that Frost's AOE rotation can feel quite cluttered. We're reducing the 
                  frequency with which you need to cast Blizzard to help the rotation breathe in AOE a bit more. We'll continue to monitor 
                  the repercussions of this change and adjust accordingly.

                  to 200%.
                • Face Palm has been redesigned – Tiger Palm damage increased by 100% and reduces the remaining cooldown of your Brews by 
                  0.5 additional seconds.
                • Invoke Niuzao has been redesigned – Summons an effigy of Niuzao, the Black Ox for 25 seconds that attacks your primary

                • Improved Invoke Niuzao has been redesigned – While active, Invoke Niuzao, the Black Ox can be recast once to cause Niuzao 
                  to stomp mightily and knock nearby enemies into the air.

        PRIEST

            - Hero Talents
                • Oracle
                    > Discipline
                        + Preventive Measures increases the absorption of Power Word: Shield by 30% (was 40%). Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Voidweaver
                    > Discipline
                        + Entropic Rift damage increased by 30%.
            - Discipline
                • Developers' notes: We’re doing some targeted adjustments to some of Discipline’s direct healing spells so that their mana 
                  gradually reduces over time if they are spending a lot of time applying Atonement. We would like Discipline to be able to 
                  regenerate mana slowly over time through using damage spells. This helps balance them against other healers who spend more 
                  mana than they do.
                • Luminous Barrier absorption increased by 100%, but its absorption now reduces more rapidly beyond 5 targets.

                • Divine Hymn healing increased by 100%, but its healing now reduces more rapidly beyond 5 targets.
                • Holy Fire mana cost reduced by 40%.
                • Holy Nova mana cost reduced by 87%.
                • Reduced the mana cost of the following spells by 5%:
                    > Flash Heal
                    > Heal
                    > Holy Word: Sanctify
                    > Holy Word: Serenity
                    > Prayer of Healing
                    > Prayer of Mending
                    > Renew
                • Surge of Light now reduces the mana cost of Flash Heal by 50% (was 100%).
                • Apotheosis now reduces the mana cost of Holy Words by 50% while active (was 100%).
                • Epiphany now ignores the current cooldown of Prayer of Mending when it triggers instead of resetting it.
            - Shadow
                • Developers' notes: The Shadow tree has undergone a number of changes in Ghosts of K'aresh that we're excited to share 
                  along with our intent with these changes.
                • A major goal for us was to update the less impactful or interesting talents in the last three rows of the tree. We like 
                  the theme with the idols as capstones but have heard from the community that some of their effects have been lacking. 
                  We've also added a new ability that can be used after Void Torrent called Void Volley which we think will be an exciting 
                  rotational and visual addition to the spec.
                • We're making some adjustments to Shadow Crash as well, giving it more flexibility and the option to significantly increase 
                  its damage. This does come with a reduction in the number of targets Vampiric Touch is applied to from 8 to 6, but we feel 
                  this is a necessary change to ensure Shadow's damage at lower target counts remains competitive when we do our tuning 
                  passes.
                • While the balance between Mind Flay and Mind Spike has been in a good place, we feel it's best to recenter the spec on its 
                  core and iconic fantasies and Mind Flay is the obvious choice for us to keep in the long term, so we're removing Mind 
                  Spike. We're keeping Mind Melt with some minor adjustments for it to support the same gameplay for Mind Flay and providing 
                  an option to choose between increasing the damage of Mind Flay and using it to increase Mind Blast damage which we think 
                  will support each Hero Talent tree in meaningfully different ways.
                • We're making a simplification change to Deathspeaker with the aim of reducing the potential number of competing priorities 
                  the spec has. We're looking to create more breathing room and clarity in the rotation while still impacting how often you 
                  use Shadow Word: Death in the rotation. We're also bringing back a previous class set we thought had fun interactions as a 
                  follow-up node to Deathspeaker.
                • Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
                • New Talent: Dark Thoughts – Increases the chance for Shadowy Insight to occur by 25%. When consuming Shadowy Insight, Mind 
                  Blast generates 1 additional Insanity.
                • New Talent: Death's Torment – Shadow Word: Death deals damage 2 additional times at 15% effectiveness.
                • New Talent: Madness Weaving – The damage bonus from your Mastery: Shadow Weaving gains 25%/50% additional benefit from 
                  Devouring Plague.
                • New Talent: Void Volley – Void Torrent is replaced with Void Volley for 20 seconds after it is cast.
                    > Void Volley – Releases a volley of pure void energy, firing 10 bolts at your target and 1 bolt at all enemies within 
                      10 yards of your target for Shadow damage. Generates 10 Insanity.
                • New Talent: Subservient Shadows – Summoned minions last 20% longer and deal an additional 15% damage.
                • New Talent: Phantom Menace – Increases the critical strike chance of Shadowy Apparitions by 10% and their critical strike 
                  damage by 40%.
                • New Talent: Instilled Doubt – Increases the critical strike chance of Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain by 8%/15% and 
                  their critical strike damage by 20%/40%.
                • New Talent: Descending Darkness – Increases Shadow Crash damage by 300%.
                • Dark Evangelism has been redesigned – Now increases periodic spell damage by 6%. 1-point talent.
                • Deathspeaker has been redesigned – Now increases the damage of Shadow Word: Death by 25% and causes it to gain its damage 
                  bonus against targets below 35% instead of 20%.
                • Idol of Y'Shaarj has been redesigned – Your damaging spells have a chance to grant Call of the Void, increasing your Haste 
                  by 15% for 12 seconds. When Call of the Void ends you are afflicted with Overburdened Mind, reducing your Haste by 10% for 
                  8 seconds.
                • Idol of N'Zoth has been redesigned – You create Horrific Visions when casting harmful spells on enemies. At 50 stacks of 
                  Horrific Visions, your target sees a nightmare, dealing Shadow damage and granting you 4 Insanity over 3 seconds. At 100 
                  stacks, your target witnesses a vision of N'Zoth, dealing high Shadow damage and granting you 12 Insanity over 3 seconds. 
                  Visual effects have been updated.
                • All damage reduced by 4%.
                • Mind Blast damage increased by 30%. Does not apply to Void Blast.
                • Mind Flay: Insanity damage increased by 20%.

                • Holy Nova mana cost reduced by 87%.
                • Psychic Link now causes direct damage to inflict 40% of their damage on all other targets afflicted by Vampiric Touch 
                  (was 35%).
                • Insidious Ire now increases damage dealt by 10%/20% (was 20%/40%).
                • Shadow Crash now has a 15 second cooldown (was 20 seconds) and has 2 charges.
                • Shadow Crash now applies Vampiric Touch to 6 targets baseline.
                • Void Torrent now has a 30 second cooldown (was 45 seconds).
                • Shadowy Apparitions can now critically strike.
                • Mind Flay now generates 18 Insanity over its duration (was 12).
                • Mental Decay increases the damage of Mind Flay by 15% (was 10%).
                • Mind Melt renamed to Shattered Psyche and now works with Mind Flay, increasing the critical strike chance of Mind Blast by
                  8% per stack, stacking up to 12 times.

                • Tormented Spirits chance to trigger now scales depending on how many Shadow Word: Pains are active. Now a 1-point talent.
                • The following talents have been removed:
                    > Malediction
                    > Mind Spike

                • Fatebound
                    > Mean Streak tooltip has been updated – No longer includes “multiple times in a row.” This clarifies the behavior that 
                      any coin flipped by Dispatch or Envenom is more likely to match the same face as the last flip.
                    > Fatebound Coin: Tails and Lucky Coin damage increased by 17%.
                    > Fixed an issue that caused the damage bonus from Fatebound Coin Heads flips to be lower than intended.

                      intended. This fix should be an overall damage increase.

            - Outlaw
                • Killing Spree has been redesigned – Finishing move that unleashes a barrage of gunfire, rapidly striking random enemies 
                  within 8 yards for Physical damage over its duration. Duration and number of strikes increase per combo point spent. 
                  Restores 1 combo point every 0.5 seconds.
                • Now a channeled ability with 0.5 second duration per combo point spent, reduced by Haste (was 0.3 seconds).
                • Can move and use some travel and defensive abilities while channeling, but movement is slowed by 20%.
                • Damage per strike increased by 25%.
                • Killing Spree now only strikes enemies in front of you and its cooldown has been increased to 3 minutes (was 1.5 minutes).
                • Killing Spree’s icon has been updated.
                • All damage increased by 13%.
                • Blade Flurry now deals 45% of single target damage to nearby enemies (was 50%).
            - Subtlety

                    > Elemental Reverb now increases Lava Burst damage by 20% (was 5%).
                • Stormbringer
                    > Tempest stacks now cancel at the start of raid encounters, Mythic+ dungeons, and between zone transfers.
                    > Enhancement
                        + Tempest now deals 50% of the primary target damage to enemies within 8 yards (was 65%).
                • Totemic
                    > Enhancement
                        + The relocation spell override aura will now cancel when Totemic Recall resets the cooldown of Surging Totem.
            - Elemental
                • Elemental Blast damage increased by 25%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Lightning Bolt damage increased by 35%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Lava Burst damage increased by 35%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Frost Shock damage increased by 50%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Earthen Rage damage increased by 35%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Earth Shock damage increased by 25%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Icefury damage increased by 35%. Does not apply to PvP combat.
                • Maelstrom Supremacy now increases the damage of Earth Shock, Elemental Blast, and Earthquake by 25% (was 15%).
                • The following spells no longer display their projectile spell effects for allies in dungeons and raids:
                    > Lava Burst Overload
                    > Lightning Bolt Overload
                    > Icefury Overload
                    > Elemental Blast Overload
                • The visual effect for Earth Shock Overload no longer displays for allies in dungeons and raids.
                • The visual effect for Earth Shock now has a smaller impact visual for allies in dungeons and raids.
                • The Single-Button Assistant and Assistant highlight recommendations now appropriately weave between Earth Shock or 
                  Elemental Blast and Earthquake when talented for Echoes of Great Sundering.
            - Enhancement
                • Thorim's Invocation secondary effect has been updated – During Ascendance, Windstrike consumes up to 5 Maelstrom Weapon to 
                  discharge a Lightning Bolt or Chain Lightning at 100% effectiveness at your enemy, whichever you most recently used. 
                    > Tempest: When available, it will instead discharge a Tempest at 100% effectiveness, consuming up to 10 Maelstrom 
                      Weapon.
                • Developers' notes: The choice of switching from casting Windstrike to Tempest felt counterintuitive to the intended 
                  gameplay of Thorim's Invocation. To improve the flow and clarity of the experience, we’re updating the interaction so that 
                  Tempest now works with Thorim's Invocation.
                • Fixed an issue causing Thorim's Invocation to sometimes cast Lightning Bolt or Chain Lightning with 10 Maelstrom Weapon 
                  instead of 5 Maelstrom Weapon.
            - Restoration
                • Healing Tide Totem healing increased by 100%, but its healing now reduces more rapidly beyond 5 targets.

        WARLOCK

            - Corruption now deals damage on application and is instant cast.
            - The scale of your primary demon is now consistent across all levels.

                    > Infernal Bolt damage increased by 55%.
                    > Flames of Xoroth now increases demon and Fire damage dealt by 4% (was 2%).
                    > Demonology
                        + Wicked Cleave damage reduced by 20%.
                        + Chaos Salvo damage reduced by 20%.
                        + Felseeker damage reduced by 20%.
                • Hellcaller
                    > Affliction
                        + Wither periodic damage increased by 15%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                        + Blackened Soul damage increased by 30%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                        + Xalan’s Ferocity now increases Fire damage dealt by 6% (was 2%).
                        + Xalan’s Cruelty now increases Shadow damage by 6% (was 2%).
                    > Destruction
                        + Wither damage reduced by 6.5%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                        + Blackened Soul damage increased by 14%.
                        + Xalan’s Ferocity now increases Fire damage dealt by 8% (was 4%).
                        + Xalan’s Cruelty now increases Shadow damage dealt by 8% (was 4%).
                • Soul Harvester
                    > Affliction
                        + Wicked Reaping damage increased by 75%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                        + Demonic Soul damage increased by 55%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                        + Soul Anathema damage increased by 40%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
            - Affliction
                • Unstable Affliction damage increased by 68%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Shadow Bolt damage increased by 25%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Drain Soul damage increased by 25%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Summon Darkglare damage increased by 35%. Does not affect PvP combat.
                • Haunt damage increased by 50%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Haunt now increases your damage dealt to the target by 12% for 18 seconds (was 10%).
                • Tormented Crescendo can now stack up to 3 times (was 2).
                • Focused Malignancy now causes Malefic Rapture to deal 80% increased damage to targets suffering from Unstable Affliction 
                  (was 40%). Does not affect PvP combat.
                • Xavian Teachings has been removed.
            - Demonology
                • Developers' notes: We are addressing two issues with the Demonology talent tree:
                    > First, we want to address the tuning of the right-side of the talent tree to increase the number of options available.
                    > Second, we are making minor changes to Demonic Tyrant’s ramp and lowering the requirements for maximizing its 
                      throughput. While we want Demonic Tyrant to be an expression of skill for Demonology, we also want maximization of its 
                      throughput to be attainable in a variety of different encounters rather than only challenges with lower mobility 
                      requirements.
                • Master Summoner is no longer a PvP talent, has been redesigned, and is now available on the Demonology specialization 
                  tree – Increases Mastery by 4% and reduces the cast time of your Call Dreadstalkers, Summon Vilefiend, and Summon Demonic 
                  Tyrant by 25%.
                • All damage dealt increased by 6%.
                • Shadow Bolt damage increased by 55%.
                • Demonbolt damage increased by 35%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Wild Imp’s Fel Firebolt damage increased by 15%.
                • Implosion damage increased by 15%.
                • Immutable Hatred damage increased by 250%.
                • Summon Demonic Tyrant now increases the damage of affected demons by 25% (was 15%).
                • Demonic Tyrant’s Demonfire damage increased by 60%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Umbral Blaze now has a 100% chance to trigger.
                • Summon Vilefiend cooldown is now 25 seconds (was 30 seconds).
                • Demonic Brutality now increases critical strike damage from your spells and demons by 6% (was 4%).
                • Improved Demonic Tactics now increases your primary Felguard’s critical strike chance by 50% of your critical strike 
                  chance (was 30%).
                • Liberation of Undermine 2-set bonus has been updated – Now summons a Greater Dreadstalker at 180% effectiveness (was 265%).
                • Liberation of Undermine 4-set bonus has been updated – Now commands your active Dreadstalkers to Dreadbite at 10% (was 20%) 
                  effectiveness. This damage is now increased by 5% per Soul Shard spent on Hand of Gul’dan (was 10%).
                • Fixed an issue where Summon Charhound and Summon Gloomhound did not match the cooldown of Summon Vilefiend.
                • Pact of the Imp Mother has swapped places with Umbral Blaze on the talent tree.
                • Developers' notes: Swapping these talents allows Umbral Blaze to exist as a means to increase single-target throughput 
                  without standing in the way of Pact of the Imp Mother, a universally useful talent.
                • The following talents have been removed:
                    > Guillotine
                    > Reign of Tyranny
            - Destruction
                • Incinerate damage increased by 50%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Conflagrate damage increased by 30%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Chaos Bolt damage increased by 32%. This change does not affect PvP combat.
                • Inferno has been removed.
                • Developers' notes: We will be removing Inferno from Destruction's talent tree. For a single talent node, Inferno is 
                  extremely powerful as it has too much control of Rain of Fire’s tuning as well as effects that activate based on Soul 
                  Shards spent.

        WARRIOR

            - The global cooldown of Hamstring is now 0.75 seconds (was 1.5 seconds).
            - Fixed an issue where Berserker Rage was able to remove Scatter Shot.
            - Berserker Rage’s tooltip has been slightly adjusted to indicate it only works on certain Incapacitate effects.
            - Hero Talents
                • Colossus
                    > Demolish’s channel will not break once begun unless the target moves over 50 yards away from the Warrior.
                    > Developers' notes: Demolish’s single-target attacks will still only hit the target if it is in melee range, and the 
                      final AOE attack will impact no more than 5 yards from the Warrior.
                    > Arms
                        + All ability damage increased by 5%.
                        + Bladestorm damage increased by 15%.
                    > Fury
                        + Developers' notes: Fury has been struggling to keep up in sustained AOE combat. These changes are aimed at 
                          bolstering Fury in these situations.
                        + All ability damage increased by 5%.
                        + Bladestorm damage increased by 15%.
                        + Whirlwind damage increased by 10%.
                        + Improved Whirlwind causes your single-target attacks to deal 65% damage to up to 4 nearby targets (was 55%).
                • Protection
                    > Developers' notes: Many of Protection Warrior's talents in each gate provide either key capabilities or powerful 
                      bonuses that make those talents "locked in". As a result, Protection Warrior builds don't change much in different 
                      situations or based on personal preferences. In Ghosts of K'aresh, we tried to ensure you have some points left after 
                      taking the "must take" talents in each gate. We did this by rearranging the tree to remove some bottleneck talents, 
                      making Challenging Shout baseline, and reducing the power of some current "must take" talents so they're at a 
                      comparable power level with optional or utility talents. Where talents lost power in this way, we gave it back in 
                      other talents or abilities, so your overall power level remains similar. Once we freed up some flexibility to choose 
                      more talents based on situation and personal preference, we added some options to let you lean into different aspects 
                      of your kit or customize your defenses.
                    > Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
                    > New Talent: Armor Specialization – Armor increased by 6%.
                    > New Talent: Heavy Handed – Execute hits up to 2 additional nearby targets for 70% damage.
                    > New Talent: Whirling Blade – Your attacks have a chance to target a nearby enemy with Ravager for 4 seconds.
                    > New Talent: Hunker Down – Damage you take from area of effect attacks is decreased by 2%. Spell Reflection reduces 
                      magic damage taken by an additional 10%.
                    > New Talent: Spellbreaker – You have a 8% chance to disrupt magic damage dealt to you, reducing the damage it deals 
                      by 50%.
                    > New Talent: Unyielding Stance – Defensive Stance reduces damage taken by an additional 4%.
                    > New Talent: Red Right Hand – Execute damage increased by 15%.
                    > Barbaric Training has been updated – Increases the damage of Revenge by 20% (was 25%) and now also increases the 
                      damage of Thunder Clap by 10%.
                    > Best Served Cold has been updated – Your dodges and parries make your Revenge cost no Rage 20% more frequently and 
                      increase the damage your free Revenges deal by 15%. Revenge increases the damage of your next Thunder Clap by 8%.
                    > Brutal Vitality has been updated – 8% of damage you deal adds to your active Ignore Pain or the next Ignore Pain you 
                      activate. Your next Ignore Pain can be increased by up to 15% of your total health.
                    > Tough as Nails has been updated – Now deals damage every time you block an attack but no longer ignores Armor. Damage 
                      increased by 100%. Tooltip updated to reflect that it deals double damage on critical blocks.
                    > Developers' notes: Tough as Nails used to have a 0.5 second delay between when it could deal damage. This delay has 
                      been removed, so it deals damage every time you block an attack. It always dealt double damage on critical blocks; 
                      that behavior has been added to the description. The intent is for it to do moderate damage against many AoE attackers 
                      and help hold threat against them.
                    > Focused Vigor has been updated – Increases Strength by 3% (was 5%), Critical Strike chance by 1% (unchanged) and no 
                      longer increases Armor.
                    > Enduring Alacrity has been updated – Increases Stamina by 5% (was 8%) and no longer increases Armor.
                    > Challenging Shout is now learned at level 16 (was a talent).
                    > Shield Charge now grants Shield Block.
                    > Sidearm hits 1 additional enemy (was 3) and its damage is increased by 180%.
                    > Developers' notes: These changes even out the value of Barbaric Training for Colossus and Mountain Thane somewhat and 
                      makes Sidearm a competitive, simple option against small numbers of targets.
                    > Reinforced Plates increases Armor by 8% per point (was 5%).
                    > Fight Through the Flames causes Defensive Stance to reduce magic damage taken by 4% (was 6%).
                    > Fueled By Violence heals for 150% of the damage dealt by Deep Wounds (was 110%).
                    > Bloodborne increases damage of your Deep Wounds and Rend bleeds by 25% (was 10/20%) and no longer affects Thunderous 
                      Roar.
                    > Punish increases Shield Slam damage by 15% (was 10%).
                    > Enduring Defenses increased to 2 points and each point increases Shield Block duration by 1 second.
                    > Shield Specialization changed to 1 point that increases Block chance by 8%.
                    > The following talents have been removed:
                        + Battering Ram
                        + Champion's Bulwark
                        + Juggernaut
                        + Show of Force
                        + Spell Block
                    > Developers' notes: Spell Block required a lot of specialized knowledge to use. Not only did you need to know when 
                      damage was coming, but also whether it was a form of magic damage that could be blocked or not and thus affected by 
                      the ability. AOE damage isn't blockable, neither is periodic damage. Some tankbusters are and others aren't. We 
                      weren't happy with the knowledge demanded to use the ability effectively.

        DELVES

            - The Delver’s Race has begun. Horde and Alliance compete head-to-head on which faction can complete the most delves in Season 3. 
              The faction that reaches the goal first will have their faction's banner planted permanently in Dornogal's Delver's 
              Headquarters. When each faction reaches this milestone, players will be awarded with Horde and Alliance themed paint colors 
              and emblems for the Delver’s Dirgible mount no matter who finishes first.

            - Players who leave runs before completion, timer end, or a successful Vote to Abandon will eventually be marked as a 
                Keystone Deserter in the Premade Dungeon Finder.
            - Marked players can complete Mythic+ runs without leaving, even if untimed, to bring themselves back into good standing and 
                remove their Deserter's Mark.

        ITEMS

            - Valorstones are no longer reset upon the start of a new season and can no longer be transferred across the Warband.
            - Mastery scaling of Cyrce's Circlet Fathomdweller's Runed Citrine reduced by 50%.
            - Fixed an issue that caused Legacy Loot Mode to be enabled at incorrect player levels for certain dungeons and raids from 
              Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands.

        PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

            - Developers' notes: We are looking at the status of tanks in PvP, particularly in the battleground format, with the goal of 
              increasing the viability of the underrepresented specializations as well as increase their incentive to flag carry in general. 
              We would like the intuitive choice of having a tank carry the flag to be generally correct and viable if they are present in a 
              match. We are also making a global change to Focused Assault and Brutal Assault with the goal of reducing the one-shot 
              possibilities and movement speed punishment at high stacks while making damage feel stickier by reducing healing taken.
            - Focused Assault and Brutal Assault now increase damage taken by 8% (was 10%) per stack, decrease healing taken by 8% per stack 
              (was 5%), and Brutal Assault’s movement speed penalty is reduced by 30%.
            - The following Ghosts of K'aresh items have had their effects reduced in PvP combat:
                • Manaforge Omega class set bonuses are 67% effective.
                • Manaforge Omega raid trinkets and cantrips are 50% effective.
                • All-Devouring Nucleus is not usable in rated PvP instance, in addition to its damage reduced by 50% in PvP combat.
                • Perfidious Projector damage reduced by 75%, instead of 50%.
                • Eco-Dome Al'dani trinkets are 50% effective.
                • Season 3 delve trinkets are 50% effective.

            RATED SOLO SHUFFLE

                - Now no longer possible to get the same player on your team 3 times in a row.
                - Protection Paladins are now treated like other Tanks for both queues and role.

            TEMPLE OF KOTMOGU

                - Floating text now appears on the player to signify when they're generating points for their team.

            DEATH KNIGHT

                - Blood
                    • New PvP Talent: Price of Progress – You sacrifice 1% of your health every 1 second and in exchange you cannot be 
                      slowed below 100% of normal speed, and you are immune to forced movement effects and knockbacks. Lasts until canceled. 
                      Replaces Death’s Advance.
                    • If a player is Death Gripped 3 times within 30 seconds by a Blood Death Knight, they become immune to Death Grip for 
                      30 seconds.

            DEMON HUNTER

                - Illidan's Grasp (PvP Talent) damage increased by 60%.
                - Vengeance
                    • New PvP Talent: Lay in Wait – Sigil of Misery has 2 charges and now lays in wait for up to 90 seconds at your selected 
                      location until an enemy approaches.
                    • Developers’ notes: While Vengeance Demon Hunters already perform well on CTF maps, their toolkit is lacking for other 
                      formats and we would like to increase their ability to handle node protection.

            EVOKER

                - Nullifying Shroud has been redesigned – Verdant Embrace wreathes you in arcane energy, preventing the next full loss of 
                  control effect against you. Lasts 4 seconds.
                - Developers' notes: Nullifying Shroud is important for Evoker to help keep them in the fray without getting locked down. 
                  However, the 3 charges and high duration of Nullifying Shroud proved to be frustrating to deal with. We feel this updated 
                  version will both be less frustrating to fight against and also feel more fluid for Evoker. In particular, this should 
                  help Preservation feel safer when using Verdant Embrace to heal allies, while also providing Augmentation and Devastation 
                  a tool to outplay their opponents.

            MAGE

                - Arcane

                      your next targeted spell by 100%. Generates 4 Arcane Charges. 15 second cooldown.
                - Slipstream now reduces your movement speed by 10% in PvP combat only.

            MONK

                - Brewmaster
                    • Niuzao’s Essence now additionally clears snares after casting Celestial Brew, Roll, or Fortifying Brew.

            PALADIN

                - Holy
                    • Fixed an issue that caused Divine Plea to restore more mana than intended.
                    • Hallowed Ground (PvP Talent) has been removed.
                - Protection
                    • Bear the Burden now decreases the cooldown of Blessing of Freedom by 4 seconds (was 2 seconds).

            PRIEST

                - Shadow

            WARLOCK

                - Master Summoner is no longer a PvP talent, has been redesigned, and is now available on the Demonology specialization 
                  tree – Increases Mastery by 4% and reduces the cast time of your Call Dreadstalkers, Summon Vilefiend, and Summon Demonic 
                  Tyrant by 25%.
                - Unstable Affliction damage increased by 35%.

            WARRIOR

                - Dragon Charge (PvP Talent) duration increased to 2.5 seconds (was 1.6 seconds).
                - Protection
                    • New PvP Talent: Power Through Adversity – Second Wind reduces damage taken by 10% to 40%, with larger attacks being 
                      reduced by more. While Shield Wall or Last Stand are active, healing reductions do not apply to you.
                    • Thunderstruck (PvP Talent) has been redesigned – After casting Avatar, Shockwave, or Stormbolt, your next Thunder Clap 
                      roots all targets it damages for 6 seconds.

        PROFESSIONS

            - New gathering materials local to K'aresh. These new K'areshi materials can be exchanged for Khaz Algar materials with Om'myuz

                - Developers' notes: We’re adding a new potion in Ghosts of K’aresh that replicates abilities such as the Night Elf Racial 
                  Shadowmeld to address its prevalence in high-end Mythic+ play. As a large number of top-performing groups rely on 
                  Shadowmeld for certain strategies, we're looking to offer access to that utility without being locked to a specific race 
                  with the goal of reducing the pressure on group composition.

            ENCHANTING
                - New Recipe: Gleeful Glamour - Ethereal – Don the mask, magically altering your appearance to that of another one of 
                  Azeroth's residents.

                  collection of Steamy Romance Novels you can write with your Steamy Romance Novel Kit.

            TAILORING

        USER INTERFACE AND ACCESSIBILITY

            - The Spell Density feature has been revamped in Ghosts of K'aresh to increase visual clarity of combat and encounters by 
              reducing spell visual effects that do not communicate important combat information to the player in addition to reducing 
              visuals based on framerate to improve performance. The Reduced setting should meet most players' needs for improving 
              visibility of encounter mechanics and performance, and Essential will provide the strongest performance-based reduction for 
              players who need it.
            - The following new cursors have been added or improved in resolution:
                • Grabbing Hand
                • Inspect
                • Drive
                • Resize
            - There are new options to increase text size on the Friends List under Options > Social.
            - Added a new sound slider for Gameplay Sound Effects under Options > Sound.
            - Toys and Expansion names are now searchable from the inventory.
            - There is now a glow on the Quest Tracker item when the active quest suggests to use the quest item.
            - Warbands' currency transfer window will remain open after a transfer transaction.
            - Event Scheduler no longer lists the continent name to avoid confusion when events are in multiple continents. Clicking on them 
              will still bring the player map to the event location.

            CHARACTER BANK UPDATES

                - The character bank has been updated and now uses the same configurations as the Warband bank.
                - Character banks now comprise tabs with per-tab settings available.
                - Each tab includes 98 slots of storage.
                - Six tabs can be purchased, costing 1 gold, 100g, 500g, 1000g, 2500g, and 5000g.
                - Bank tabs are automatically unlocked on login. At level 80, all tabs are unlocked automatically.
                - For characters below level 80, the number of tabs available will be based on how many bag slots (including reagent bank 
                  and void storage) were available to the character before the update.
                - The reagent bank has been removed.
                - Any bank tab can now serve as a reagents tab.
                - The entire character bank can now be crafted out of, just like the reagent bank.
                - Void storage has been removed.
                - All items previously contained in character banks, reagent banks, and void storage are automatically moved to available 
                  tabs in the new bank upon login after the patch.
                - Please note that, during times of great demand, it is possible for the conversion to not initiate when you first log into 
                  a character. Additionally, until the conversion is completed, access to your bank will be disabled.
